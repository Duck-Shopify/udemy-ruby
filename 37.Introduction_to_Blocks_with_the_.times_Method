 #10.times { |count| puts "we are on number #{count+1}"}

# 3.times do | iteration |
# puts "We are currently on loop number #{iteration + 1}"
# puts "Dustin is awesome!"
# puts "I'm having a great time learning Ruby!"
# end

#Challenge:

# Use the times method to put the first ten multiples of 3.
# (3,6,9)

 #my answer: 10.times { |count| puts "we are on number #{3*(count+1)}"}

 #actual answer:

 10.times do |count|
 puts "Allright, let's show the next multiple!"
 puts "#{3*(count +1)}"
 end
